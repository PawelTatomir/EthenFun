# Ethena Head or Tail Game 🎮


## Project Overview
This project is part of the Ethena Hackathon, implementing a fun and interactive Head or Tail game using Ethena's technology stack. Players can participate in a decentralized betting game where they can wager on the outcome of a coin flip using USDe tokens.


## 🚀 Features
- Decentralized Head or Tail betting game
- Integration with Ethena's USDe stablecoin
- Real-time game statistics using The Graph Protocol
- User-friendly Next.js frontend interface
- Smart contract-based game logic for transparency and fairness

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Indexing**: The Graph Protocol
- **Stablecoin**: Ethena USDe
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.





## 🎮 How to Play
1. Connect your wallet
2. Get some USDe tokens
3. Choose Heads or Tails
4. Place your bet
5. Wait for the result
6. Collect your winnings (if you win!)

## 📝 Smart Contract Details
The game's smart contracts are deployed on the following networks:
- Ethereum Mainnet: [Contract Address]
- Testnet: [Contract Address]

## 🔍 The Graph Integration
We use The Graph Protocol to index and query game events, providing real-time statistics and game history. The subgraph can be found at [Subgraph URL].

## 🏆 Sponsor Technologies Used

### Ethena Labs Integration
- Implemented USDe stablecoin as the primary betting token
- Utilized sUSDe for reward distribution to winners
- Smart contracts interact directly with Ethena's protocol

### Goldsky Integration
- Built a custom subgraph for real-time game tracking
- Indexing all game events and statistics
- Deployed at `subgraph/` directory
- Efficient querying of historical game data and player statistics

### LayerZero Integration
- Implemented cross-chain functionality using O-App
- Enables players to participate from multiple chains
- Unified liquidity across different networks

## 🎯 Unique Value Proposition
Our Head or Tail game demonstrates innovative use of:
1. sUSDe Rewards: Players earn additional yields through sUSDe staking
2. Cross-chain Gaming: LayerZero O-App enables seamless multi-chain experience
3. Real-time Analytics: Goldsky subgraph provides instant game statistics
